# Empirica Take-Home Programming Tasks

This repository contains my implementation of the core task and three bonuses involved in the take-home interview.

## Summary of major changes:
* Moved scoring functionality server-side to ensure all scoring computations were done before displaying the results page, implemented in the following function in `server/callbacks.js`
```js
function computePlayerScore(player, roundStr, warrantValue, challengeProbability)
```
* Built out a system warrant advertisements, with appropriate incentives and penalities built-in. The parameters for penalizing and incentivizing warrants are also included as treatments in the Empirica config files, so they can be customized when launching a new experiment to determine their ideal values.
* Added a synced leaderboard to the Results page, so that users can see how the market is doing after a certain round.
* Built a basic admin dashboard in `Admin Dashboard.ipynb` to track and visualize users' decisions over the rounds of an experiment
* Restructured the UI of the experimenmt and broke up the user's decisions into three pages, with page 1 comprising production quality decisions, page 2 involving the selling price, and the third page offering advertisement-related options.
* Basic code refactoring (extracted functions for repeated tasks and added documentation in some instances). For instances, the following function was extracted from `Advertisements.jsx`:
```js
function NLineBreaks(n) {
    return [...Array(n).keys()].map(item => <br/>)
}
```

The way I would implement warrants in this marketplace is similar to stamps of verification present in other marketplaces today (more on which is described in question 2 below). The general idea is that a producer can either choose to spend $W$ dollars on a warrant, for which their ad would be visible to $V$ users; alternatively, the producer can choose not to warrant their advertisement, in which case the ad will be shown to $100$ users. By default, we set the minimum possible number of buyers to $0$ (if no warrant) or $100$ (if there is a warrant), and the maximum number of potential buyers to $100$ (if no warrant) or $V$ (if there is a warrant); the process for choosing these values is described in more detail later in this response. However, these values for the minimum and maximum number of buyers may change due to one of two scenarios:
1. The product is advertised as high-quality toothpaste and costs $15$ dollars: since fewer people would likely pay a premium for high-quality toothpaste, this cuts the number of potential buyers by $30$%. That is, the maximum number of buyers in this scenario is $0.7V$ if the producer warranted their ad, or $(0.7)(100)=70$ otherwise.
3. The product is advertised as low-quality toothpaste and costs $15$ dollars: in this case, even fewer people would pay a premium for toothpaste advertised as low-quality, and so this would reduce the number of potential buyers by $90$%. This sets the maximum number of buyers in this scenario to $0.1V$ if the producer warranted their ad, or $(0.1)(100)=10$ otherwise.

We then perform a random draw from $[minBuyers, maxBuyers)$ to determine how many of the ad's viewers would actually purchase the toothpaste. The user's sales can be computed with this value, and this information is then displayed to the user on the Results page.

To determine the ideal values of V, and W, I set out with two goals in mind:
1. Producers with honest ads should have as little chance of being penalized for warranting their ads as possible.
2. Producers with dishonest ads should fare worse than producers being honest. More specifically, a dishonest producer is defined as one that manufactures low-quality toothpaste, yet markets high-quality toothpaste to consumers. Although there is another possiblitiy (making high-quality toothpaste yet marketing low-quality toothpaste), this is less likely and is penalized by default, so it won't be considered below.

After simulating multiple possible values for $V$ and $W$, I settled on the following: a warrant should cost $1000$ dollars, and should spread the ad to $2000$ users. However, I also added these parameters as factors in the Empirica `treatments.yaml` file, so that experiment administrators can change them to observe the effects of different rewards/penalties.

**Short Answer (500 words)**: *Discuss why this feature is reflective of a real-world marketplace and what kind of trade-offs you would want to consider to make this feature easy for users to employ.*<br/>

This feature is reflective of a real-word marketplace, because several marketplaces we deal in on a regular basis use a very similar system to indicate to customers the true quality of a product. For instance, various food products have stamps on them to certify from the Food and Drug Administration, that they are of the quality they say they are. In a very different context, various social media accounts can be granted verification status by the platform to indicate to users that the account is trustworthy and genuine (Paul et al. 2019). Both the above approaches involve a central authority making the call as to whether or not a food product deserves an "FDA-Approved" label, or whether an Instagram account deserves to be veritifed. In this experiment, challenges are resolved by the server, which knows the true quality of the product, as well as its advertised quality, but in the real world, a central authority of some kind would need to be established to determine products' true quality. However, some trade-offs were made for simplicity's sake, making this feature easier to use both for producers and consumers. For instance, a potential use of the warrant might be as a slider of values, rather than a single option; in our scenario, a user either purchases a $1000 warrant, or does not warrant their advertisement at all. Instead, we might allow for them to choose from various levels of warrants, to alter the levels of risk they are willing to take in this market. However, this makes things complicated both for the producers, who now have to determine the ideal value to warrant their advertisements with, and for viewers of the ad, who now have to keep track of various levels of warrants, and how much trust they can really put into ads.
